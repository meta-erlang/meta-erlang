SUMMARY = "A release assembler for Erlang."
DESCRIPTION = "Relx assembles releases for an Erlang/OTP release. Given a release specification and a list of directories in which to search for OTP applications it will generate a release output. That output depends heavily on what plugins available and what options are defined, but usually it is simply a well configured release directory."
