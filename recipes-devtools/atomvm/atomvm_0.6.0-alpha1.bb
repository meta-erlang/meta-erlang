SUMMARY = "Tiny Erlang VM"
DESCRIPTION = "Brings Erlang, Elixir and other functional languages to really small systems. \
AtomVM implements from scratch a minimal Erlang VM that supports a subset of ErlangVM features \
and that is able to run unmodified BEAM binaries on really small systems like MCUs."
