SUMMARY = "rebar is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang applications, port drivers and releases."
DESCRIPTION = "rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP conventions for project structures, thus minimizing the amount of build configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of locations (git, hg, etc)."
